
LINEAR SEARCH :

Step 1: Set i to 1
Step 2: if i > n then go to step 7
Step 3: if A[i] = x then go to step 6
Step 4: Set i to i + 1
Step 5: Go to Step 2
Step 6: Print Element x Found at index i and go to step 8
Step 7: Print element not found
Step 8: Exit




BINARY SEARCH :

Step 1: set beg = lower_bound, end = upper_bound, pos = - 1  
Step 2: repeat steps 3 and 4 while beg <=end  
Step 3: set mid = (beg + end)/2  
Step 4: if a[mid] = val  
set pos = mid  
print pos  
go to step 6  
else if a[mid] > val  
set end = mid - 1  
else  
set beg = mid + 1  
[end of if]  
[end of loop]  
Step 5: if pos = -1  
print "value is not present in the array"  
[end of if]  
Step 6: exit
