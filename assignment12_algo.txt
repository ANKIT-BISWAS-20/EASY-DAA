1. If N is odd, then puzzle instance is solvable if number of inversions is even in the input state.
2. If N is even, puzzle instance is solvable if
• the blank is on an even row counting from the bottom (second-last, fourth-last, etc.) and number of
inversions is odd.
• the blank is on an odd row counting from the bottom (last, third-last, fifth-last, etc.) and number of
inversions is even.
3. For all other cases, the puzzle instance is not solvable.
