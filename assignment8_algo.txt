BFS ALGORITHM :


1. Insert starting node into the queue.
2. Delete front element from the queue and insert all its unvisited neigh bours into the queue at the
end and traverse them. Also make the value of visited array true for these nodes.
3. Repeat step 2 until the queue is empty.


DFS ALGORITHM :


1. Push starting node into the stack.
2. Pop an element from the stack, if it has not been traversed then traverse it. If it has already been
traversed then just ignore it. after traversing make the value of visited array true for this node.
3. Push all the unvisited adjacent nodes of the popped element on stack. No need to Push the element
even if it is already on the stack.
4. Repeat step 2 and 3 until stack is empty.
