KNAPSACK :


1. Consider all the items with their weights and profits mentioned respectively.

2. Calculate Pi/Wi of all the items and sort the items in descending order based on their Pi/Wi values.

3. Without exceeding the limit, add the items into the knapsack.

4. If the knapsack can still store some weight, but the weights of other items exceed the limit, the fractional part of the next time can be added.

5. Hence, giving it the name fractional knapsack problem.





JOB SEQUENCING :


1. Find the maximum deadline value from the input set of jobs.

2. Once, the deadline is decided, arrange the jobs in descending order of their profits.

3. Selects the jobs with highest profits, their time periods not exceeding the maximum deadline.

4. The selected set of jobs are the output.
